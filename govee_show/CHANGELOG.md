# Changelog

## 0.2.0

- Timeline editor with song waveform, one track per device, draggable and resizable effect clips,
  beat markers (tap, BPM fill, click to add or remove) with snapping, zoom and undo.
- Seven effects: solid, fade, chase, rainbow, strobe, twinkle and wipe, each previewed live per segment.
- Device discovery over the Govee LAN API, manual add by IP, and a test pattern for checking segment
  count and direction.
- Shows saved to the add-on config folder and baked into precomputed frames on save.
- Playback from the browser: the song plays in the browser and the add-on streams frames to the
  lights over Govee's realtime (razer) protocol, kept in sync with the audio.
- Songs from the Home Assistant media folder or uploaded through the editor (saved to
  `/media/govee_show`).
- Play the song on a Home Assistant media player, with the lights following it and a delay
  setting per speaker.
- Automations: MQTT discovery entities (show select, play and stop buttons, status sensor) when a
  broker is set up, and play/stop commands through the `hassio.addon_stdin` action.

## 0.1.0

- Initial add-on skeleton with a placeholder ingress page.
